# What

**world4search** is a search engine for the textboards that historically made up [world4ch](http://www.4chan.org/faq#were) but are now part of [4chan](http://4chan.org/) proper.

# Why

Several scrapers already existed for Shiichan in general and world4ch specifically ([/prog/scrape](https://github.com/Cairnarvon/progscrape) being the first and most popular), but they tend to dump a board's content into a local SQL-style database, which is difficult to query and less than convenient for the casual discussionist. A search engine has a lower entrance barrier and doesn't require that everyone maintain their own index.

# How

If all you want is to use the search engine, you'll find a running copy [here](http://world4search.no-ip.org:8080).

If you want to deploy your own search engine, [try the wiki](https://github.com/Cairnarvon/world4search/wiki).
